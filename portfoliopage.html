                    <p>The primary project for my second term programming class was the development of a vehicle quotation calculator. The attached image showcases the user interface, which allows users to select a vehicle, modify options, and compute the total cost inclusive of sales tax. The calculator also provides the functionality to estimate monthly payments if the user opts for vehicle financing. This requires the user to input a down payment, an interest rate, and a loan term. This assignment holds a special place in my heart since despite the numerous challenges and obstacles encountered during its development, I still persevered and found solutions to solve the problem which I found as a rewarding experience. The step-by-step process throughout the term not only helped me overcome hurdles but also made the journey enjoyable. Through trial and error, I learned to create functionalities using C# and the Windows Forms framework for the user interface. This project stands as a testament to my growth and learning in the second term.

                    <p>This represents my first venture into web development. I selected this project as it marked the first instance where I successfully crafted an HTML and CSS design from the ground up. Despite the simplicity of the elements used, I managed to emulate the appearance of a typical website by arranging them in the appropriate format. This project served as a platform to exhibit my proficiency in integrating CSS and HTML, while also highlighting my creative prowess and critical thinking abilities.
